# Linear-Regression-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
In this ML course tutorial, we are going to learn the “Linear Regression Machine Learning Algorithm in detail. we covered Simple Linear regression and Multiple Linear regression supervised regression learning algorithm by practical 

Python | Linear Regression using sklearn:
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.


Simple Linear Regression in Python (From Scratch):
Simple linear regression is a concept that you may be familiar with already from middle school or high school. If you have ever heard of a slope and an intercept, or y = mx + b, then you have already learned about simple linear regression!
The simple linear regression equation we will use is written below. The constant is the y-intercept (𝜷0), or where the regression line will start on the y-axis. The beta coefficient (𝜷1) is the slope and describes the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The coefficient can be positive or negative and is the degree of change in the dependent variable for every 1-unit of change in the independent variable.
For example, let's say we have a regression equation of y = 2 + 0.5x. For every 1-unit increase in the independent variable (x), there will be a 0.50 increase in the dependent variable (y).
First, we will import the Python packages that we will need for this analysis. All we will need is NumPy, to help with the math calculations, Pandas, to store and manipulate the data and Matplotlib (optional), to plot the data.
